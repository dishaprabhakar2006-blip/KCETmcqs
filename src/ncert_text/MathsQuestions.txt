*(Note: The optimal point is a fraction, (20/13, 36/13), which gives a profit of 152/13 ≈ 11.69. Let me recheck the typical KCET problem constraints... usually they result in integer corner points. Let me re-verify the corner points: (0,0) Z=0; (4,0) Z=8; (0,4) Z=12; Intersection of 3x+2y=12 and x+5y=20 is (20/13, 36/13) Z = (20/13)*2 + (36/13)*3 = (40+108)/13 = 148/13 ≈ 11.38. The max value is 12 at (0,4). Let's find a better KCET-style problem... A common pattern is having integer solutions. Let's adjust the profit function to Z = 3x+5y. Then at (0,4) Z=20, at (4,0) Z=12, at (20/13, 36/13) Z=60/13+180/13=240/13~18.46. The max is 20 at (0,4). Let's use that.*
